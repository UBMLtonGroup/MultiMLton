>The Basis library is the library of standard types, functions and modules
that are built-in for the Standard ML language.  There is a set of
reference documentation in the form of HTML pages for the library.  You
can download this documentation from the SML/NJ home page[<SPAN
CLASS="CITATION"
><A
HREF="b6666.html#BIBE.SML"
><I
>SML</I
></A
></SPAN
>].
You will need a copy of this documentation to follow the programming
examples in this book.</P
><P
>In this chapter I will give you a brief overview of the library and
discuss in more detail some of the more obscure features of the library.
At the time of writing this, a more detailed book on the library is
still in preparation (by another author).</P
><P
>You should also have a copy of the source code of the SML/NJ compiler.
The <A
HREF="a6548.html"
>Appendix C</A
> describes how to download it.  The compiler
is itself written in SML.  The only part you need to pay attention to
is the <TT
CLASS="COMPUTEROUTPUT"
>boot/</TT
> directory.  This contains the source code of the
Basis library as well as the SML/NJ extensions.  I find it very useful
to consult this when the documentation is unclear.</P

>Start by reading the Introduction to the library in the Basis
documentation all the way through.  Then read the &quot;SML'96 Changes&quot;
section.  This documents changes to the language since some of the books
and tutorials on SML were written.  The most notable changes for system
programming are the addition of:</P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>   the <TT
CLASS="COMPUTEROUTPUT"
>char</TT
> type and character literals (previously characters
            were represented by strings of length 1);</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>   unsigned integer types called <TT
CLASS="COMPUTEROUTPUT"
>word</TT
> with sizes of 8, 31 and 32, and 
            the <TT
CLASS="COMPUTEROUTPUT"
>0w</TT
> prefix for their literals;</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>   hexadecimal signed and unsigned integers.</P
></LI
></UL
><P
>The value polymorphism restriction is not something you will likely
encounter. For the purposes of this book it mainly requires you to ensure
that imperative variables using the <TT
CLASS="COMPUTEROUTPUT"
>ref</TT
> type are restricted to
contain a specific declared type.</P
><P
>The section on type abbreviations in signatures allows type declarations
like the type <TT
CLASS="COMPUTEROUTPUT"
>Option</TT
> in <A
HREF="x443.html#GETOPT2"
>the section called <I
>Getopt with a Hash Table</I
> in Chapter 2</A
>.  I won't pay
any attention to opaque signature matching but you will see it in some
of the library source where a signature is matched using &quot;<TT
CLASS="COMPUTEROUTPUT"
>:&#62;</TT
>&quot;
instead of &quot;<TT
CLASS="COMPUTEROUTPUT"
>:</TT
>&quot;.  The difference is that the opaque form ensures
that a type can be exported from a module with absolutely no information
about its implementation being available.  Normally the compiler peeks
inside modules and can recognise when different type names exported
from different modules are the same type because they have the same
representation inside the module.</P
><P
>The next section on the &quot;Top Level Environment&quot; lists all of the types and
functions that are available directly without having to be qualified by
a module name.  The phrase &quot;top level&quot; refers to the level of the prompt
you get when you start up the SML compiler.  All of these top-level names
are associated with one of the library modules and are documented in
more detail there.  This section just provides are reference for what
names don't need module qualification.  The overloading of operators
and their precedence is also presented.</P
