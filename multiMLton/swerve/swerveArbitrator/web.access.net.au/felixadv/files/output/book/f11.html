>This book is a study in system programming using the Standard ML language.
(In the rest of the book this language will be referred to as SML).
Standard ML is one of several languages in the ML family, the other main
one being OCaml[<SPAN

>], but this book concentrates on Standard ML
and in particular the Standard ML of New Jersey (SML/NJ) implementation.
I will revisit some related languages in the concluding chapter.</P
><P
>SML belongs to the class of functional programming languages.  Functional
languages are very high-level languages that are often thought of
as academic curiosities, not up to the job of real-world programming.
This book aims to show that functional languages, in particular SML,
can be used for real-world programs.  </P
><P
>The definition of system programming is a bit fuzzy.  This book will
only cover programming in the Unix operating system. In Unix, by system
programming, I mean being able to write infrastructure programs such as
daemons and utilities that interact with other programs, not necessarily
directly with the user.  </P

><P
>I've seen many postings on Usenet news groups and mailing lists by
programmers interested in using functional languages who have been unable
to get very far due to the paucity of documentation and training material.
What material on functional programming that is available tends to be
either rather academic or only at an introductory level with small toy
examples.  This book aims at improving this situation by working through
a project more typical of real-world programs.  In addition there will
be smaller examples in tutorial chapters.</P
><P
>The major project in this book is a web server. It is similar in
functionality to the early CERN server. It supports CGI programming but
only does the original HTTP 1.0 protocol.</P
><P
>You, dear reader, should be a programmer familiar with Unix programming
using conventional languages such as C, C++ or Java. You have probably
been introduced to functional programming at college and retained an
interest in the subject but not had the opportunity to take it further.
Microsoft Windows programmers with some familiarity with the Posix
standards will benefit from this book too.</P
><P
>You should already have some familiarity with SML or other languages
in the ML family, or enough familiarity with functional languages
that you can pick up the language from a tutorial.  This book is not
a course on SML.  There are a number of books available that teach
programming in SML.  There are also some tutorials available on the web.
