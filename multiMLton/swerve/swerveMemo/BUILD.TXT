Background
==========
The original author wrote swerve using SML/NJ and the CM system.  I did a bit of refactoring and created the necessary mlb files to compile under MLton.  The Makefile and associated .cm files are broken.

Hopefully an MLton compile of swerve is the following few steps.

Build as follows.
================

Prequisites
===========
MLton must be installed.

Compiling
=========

1. Untar
2. cd main
3. mlton main.mlb

Running
=======
In the web.access.net.au is the contents of the original author's web site.  Since he was using the implementation of swerve as an exemplar of SML development ofor a book he was authoring I delegate all documentation about swerve to the above mentioned content.

Edit: Edit the www/swerve.cfg file.  For security reasons Swerver requires the various paths such as for the doc root to be absolute paths.  Change the /code prefix to reflect that path to the www/ directory.

Run: ./main/main -f www/server.cfg

Test: Point a browser to port 8081 where serve is running.

To stop the Swerver server use C^c.  This will leave two dropping files in www/var, a 'pid' and 'lock' file. You need to delete both of them before attempting to run another instance of the server.

For real documentation refer to the contents in web.access.net.au

Good luck.
