smllibs
=======

This directory contains an MLton compilable version of the SML Libs code which was originally written as user library code for the SML/NJ compiler.  The MLton group keeps a MLton compilable version of this code for compatability purposes.

This is a few junk files that I wrote that were somehow introduced as dependencies to build swerve when I was learning SML and porting Swerve.  I think only a few are truely needed.  I just copied the whole directory.
