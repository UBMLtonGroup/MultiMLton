Performance Comparison -- Spectralnorm
====================================

* spectralnorm-seq.sml
		Standard ML version, compiled with MLton. Should be run as
		./spectralnorm-seq <SIZE>.

* spectralnorm-par.sml
		MultiMLton version. Should be run as ./spectralnorm-par @MLton
		number-processors <N> -- <SIZE> <NUM_THEADS>. For best performance, use
		NUM_THREADS = 2 * N - 1.

* spectralnorm.ghc-2.hs
		Haskell version. Compiled with GHC. Run as ./spectralnorm.ghc-4.ghc_run +RTS
		-N<NUM_PROC> -RTS <SIZE>.

* spectralnorm.java
		Java version. Run as java  -server -XX:+TieredCompilation
		-XX:+AggressiveOpts spectralnorm <SIZE> <NUM_PROC>.

* spectralnorm.gcc-4.c
		GCC + OpenMP version. Run as ./spectralnorm.gcc-4.gcc_run <SIZE>. By
		default, runs with 48 threads, which can be changed using the NUM_THREADS
		macro.
